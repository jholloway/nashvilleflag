# How Can I Help?

## Sign the Petition
The best and easiest thing you can do is sign our petition on [x]. Proving that members of the community support the idea of giving Nashville a new flag will be the key to gaining interest and support among the Metro Council, who will ultimately decide the final legal fate of this project.

## Submit Your Design
The designs we’ve presented here are just samples, and are by no means the final designs we will be choosing from or presenting to Council members. If there’s a good idea out there for Nashville’s new flag, we want to see it.

If you have an idea for a flag design, there are a few ways to submit it. If you’re a professional artist or designer with access to tools like Photoshop or Illustrator, feel free to submit your design digitally using our online submission form. If you’re not the digital type or you just prefer doing your work on paper, download our worksheet, print it out, and send it back using the included instructions.

We welcome flag designs from anyone who’d like to participate in the project, but special consideration will be given to artists who call Nashville home.

## Sponsor Our Movement
If you run a business or organization who supports this effort, we would love your official endorsement. Support from commercial or charitable enterprises will carry real weight when working with the Council, and your name attached to this project would make a huge difference. Cash or in-kind donations are by no means required, but are greatly appreciated if they meet the project’s specific needs.

## Share Your Contacts
Nashville is a famously friendly town where everybody knows everybody. As such, you probably have some really important friends or acquaintances at local businesses, organizations, or within our city’s government. If you do, we’d love for you to make an introduction. Feel free to CC us ([x]) on any communication to your associates regarding this project.

## Volunteer to Spread the Word
We are excited about the prospect of a groundswell of support for this project in the community, but we can’t reach everyone on our own. We need you to share with your friends, family, and colleagues. If you have the means and ability, pass out flyers or hang them publicly in your office. Approach local organizations to garner their support and feedback. Talk to people on the street about the project. If you can’t do anything else, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and share our story via social media with your network.

## Donate
We know this process will be long, difficult, and tiring. Fortunately, we don’t think it will be very expensive. Our campaign’s primary costs will come from logistical items like printing flyers, mailing documents, legal paperwork application fees, and web hosting. We would also love to be able to pay reasonable fees to the talented artists and designers who have helped us along the way. 

Any and all money raised during this campaign will go directly towards fostering support among citizens and the Metro Council to adopt a new flag design. Our members are doing this as a passion project and will never take any form of payment.

This project will happen even if the costs have to come out of our pockets, but if you have the means and would like to donate, you can do so via PayPal, Square Cash, or Facebook. [x]
