# What Makes a Good Flag?

## 1. Simplicity
Our city is complicated and intricate, but our flag doesn’t have to be. A good flag is made up of only a few main visual elements. You should be able to describe it accurately to someone who’s never seen it before. A child should be able to draw it freehand from memory.

## 2. Meaning
Nashville is rich with culture and history, and we should wear it with pride. Our city is more than just a seal on a bedsheet. Colors, shapes, iconography, and relationships between elements can all convey meaning in a pleasing and practical manner.

## 3. Colorful
Simple color palettes help flags remain iconic and striking. A good flag will be used in a variety of media and contexts, and simple, solid colors will allow our flag’s design to work not only as a sheet of cloth, but on paper, screens, clothing, and more.

## 4. Bold
A city’s seal or coat of arms serves a great purpose, but that purpose is not on a flag. Flags are most often viewed at a distance and in motion, which makes the small details in a seal or words of any kind very difficult to make out. And unlike symbols, words only convey meaning if you are able to read the language they’re written in.

## 5. Distinctive
There are thousands of flags in the world, some of which are similar, but the best ones can’t be confused for anything else. Our city is unique and unlike any other, and it deserves a unique flag to represent it.

## 6. Inclusive
The five previous principles come straight from the fine folks at the North American Vexillological Association, and they are the gold standard for flag design guidelines. We propose one additional principle: a flag’s design should be accessible and inclusive to all those it represents.

Like the United States itself, our city is awash with many different cultures. But rather than homogenize our various ideals, we should embrace and respect what makes these backgrounds special and unique. We should understand that symbols, words, and even colors convey meaning in different ways to different people, including to those that are differently abled.

As such, a flag should represent all citizens regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, creed, language, physical ability, mental capacity, and even visual acuity. If we follow NAVA’s five principles, most of this will come naturally. But let’s make sure to go the extra mile.

# What's Wrong With Nashville's Current Flag?
We hear you already: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." However, we would argue that Nashville’s flag *is* broken. Out of the six principles listed above, it fails every single one. Our previous city flag was a little better, but still falls down under scrutiny. We can and must do better.

Our current flag features lettering and tiny details that are completely lost when viewed in a flag’s typical setting. The colors are garish and lack meaning. The primary element of the flag is the city’s seal, the true meaning of which is unknown. Not only is it indistinct, it could easily be confused for dozens of other municipal flags that follow the same format.

Keeping the current flag isn’t likely to actively hurt our city, but changing it represents an opportunity to create a rallying symbol for our community and put Nashville on the map in yet another arena.
