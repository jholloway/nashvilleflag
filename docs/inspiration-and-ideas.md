## What Should Nashville’s Flag Look Like?

### Layout
There’s no single way to design a flag. They come in all shapes, sizes, and layouts. Vexillologists define common layouts like a canton, pale, fess, or saltire, but none of these are rules to be followed. Ideally, our flag should conform to the North American standard of 3 feet by 5 feet.

### Color
NAVA defines the basic flag colors as red, blue, green, black, yellow, and white. Certainly there is room for exploration beyond these, but a standard palette helps reinforce good design principles. Special consideration should be paid to clarity for people with all levels of visual acuity, including color blindness. 

### Shapes
Basic shapes have a home on many different flags, from nations to cities. Bars, stripes, crosses, stars, circles, crescents, and other shapes can not only be attractive design elements, they can convey meaning through placement, number, size, and relationship.

#### Growth & Opportunity
One of the few elements of Nashville’s current flag that makes sense is the compass rose encircling the city’s seal. According to the city’s historians, this represents “the unlimited horizons of the opportunities ahead.” Considering our explosive growth, this is as true today as it was 50 years ago.

#### Cumberland River
Throughout the 1800’s, the Cumberland became the lifeblood of the settlement by enabling rapid growth and economic expansion via riverboat trade. In May of 2010, the destruction caused by the flooding of the river’s banks brought Nashvillians together to regroup and rebuild.

#### State Capital & Largest City
Nashville became the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee in 1826, and is home to the state’s legislature. While we won’t officially know for a few years, recent estimates suggest Nashville has surpassed Memphis as the state’s most populous city.

#### Consolidated City-County
Originally two separate entities, what we think of as Nashville today is actually a consolidated and unified city and county, the first of its kind in the nation. Merged in 1963, Nashville and Davidson County make up one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States.

#### Music
Since the mid-1900’s, music and Nashville have been intertwined, and today the city is the second-largest center of music production in the nation. And it’s not just country -- every genre of music is represented, including pop, rock, jazz, and even opera.

#### Healthcare
The healthcare industry is responsible for more jobs in Nashville than any other, and it brings in nearly $40 billion to our local economy every year. Our world-class healthcare facilities are a shining example of Southern hospitality.

#### Schools
Vanderbilt, Belmont, Lipscomb, Tennessee State, Trevecca… these are just the most well-known colleges and universities in the city. Our legendary higher education institutions and pioneering public school system has earned us the moniker “Athens of the South.”

#### Forts
Fort Nashborough was the inflection point for what would eventually become our entire great city, and Fort Negley was the largest inland fort built during the American Civil War. Both of these structures have become important historic sites in Nashville.

#### Food
Nashville cemented its place in the pantheon of Southern delicacies with our famous hot chicken, but we’ve also adopted many other down-home favorites and made them our own. From barbecue to biscuits, food is an inseparable part of our city’s culture.

#### Caves
Our region is well-known for its caverns, and important parts of Nashville’s history lie underground. French-Canadian fur trader Timothy Demonbreun, often referred to as our “first citizen,” originally settled in an unassuming cave on the banks of the Cumberland.

### What To Avoid

#### Tennessee Flag
Tennessee’s flag is iconic, and one of the best-designed of any state. We love our state flag and don’t want to take anything away from it, so we would advise any Nashville city flag to avoid confusion with Tennessee’s flag.

#### Complicated Symbols
Complex iconography may have special meaning to our city, but it takes away from the design of a flag. To restate one of the guiding principles of flag design, symbols should be able to be drawn in their entirety from memory. This increases recall and allows the design to be used in a variety of ways without alteration.

#### Intricate Lines or Cuts
Flag production can be complicated and expensive, so let’s strive to remove as many roadblocks as possible. Shapes and symbols should have clean, smooth edges with as few curves and angles as possible. For example, a 1:1 recreation of the Cumberland River would not translate well to a flag, but a simplified and stylized version could work.

## Who Else Is Doing This?
At least 50 municipalities across the United States are experiencing government-led or grassroots efforts to change and improve their city flags. Here are just a few of the most notable examples.

### Provo, UT
This suburb of Salt Lake City threw out one of the nation’s worst city flags and officially adopted a beautiful new design, unanimously approved by its city council.

### South Bend, IN
South Bend held a groundbreaking design contest for their new city flag. Officially unveiled in 2016, the design is open-source and belongs to the people.

### Bellingham, WA
While still unofficial, Bellingham’s fresh flag is gaining popularity with local businesses and organizations. Its designer hopes that it will be adopted someday soon.

### Milwaukee, WI
The flag of Wisconsin’s largest city has been called a “hot mess,” and a “train wreck,” among other things. Enterprising designer Steve Kodis started a campaign to change that. This stunning new design is awaiting an official hearing.

### San Francisco, CA
While it’s still in the early stages, podcaster and vexillophile Roman Mars, who has inspired many flag redesign efforts across the nation, hopes to eventually improve the flag of one of America’s largest cities.
