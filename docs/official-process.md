# Official Process

## What Will It Take to Make It Official?
While we referenced Nashville’s “current” flag throughout this project, neither the Charter or Code of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County actually designate an official design for the city’s flag. Our end goal is to add official language to the city’s guiding documents describing and codifying a new official flag.

This is not as easy as it sounds. For an ordinance (or “bill”) to be enacted or a resolution to be adopted, it must be presented and read in front of at least one Council meeting, and before that it must be heard and discussed at a Committee meeting.

Members of the public generally do not speak at Metro Council meetings, and although Committee meetings are open to the public, citizens may not testify at these meetings unless called upon by a Committee member.

Our best hope of pushing an official and legal flag redesign forward is to work with individual members of appropriate Metro Committees, gain allies across the Council, and find a sponsor who will present an ordinance that will eventually be read and voted upon at a Metro Council meeting.

But before we can do any of that, we have to show Council members that this idea has the broad support of taxpayers, organizations, and businesses across our city. That’s why we’re soliciting your signatures on a petition and recruiting volunteers in all facets of Nashville life to reach out to anyone who will listen.

While the Council is sometimes divided on issues, we believe we have identified some key players within our city’s legislature that will agree with our assessment of Nashville’s current flag and work with us on a resolution. With the help of these men and women, we have high hopes that our arguments will be heard. From there, we are at the mercy of the Council and their process.

Another possible (albeit much less likely) path is to get the Mayor to issue an executive order declaring a new official flag. We do not find this option likely and therefore will not pursue it as an option, barring extreme circumstances.

We’re not sure how long this will take. If we get overwhelming support from the public and find enthusiastic partners on the Council, the timeline could be short. But we want to be realistic and take our time to get things right, so we anticipate that it will be at least a year from the time of the project's inception before a bill would even be read before the Council.

If the worst happens and we are unable to find support with the Metro City Council, there’s nothing stopping us as the people of Nashville from uniting under a new People’s Flag. While this flag won’t be legal or official, it will still be ours. Bellingham and Milwaukee are excellent case studies of this scenario. In both instances, the redesigned flags have gained immense support from citizen, and official adoption could still be in their future.
