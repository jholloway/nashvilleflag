### Why Does Nashville Need a New Flag? {#why}

### What Is Nashville's Current Flag?

### What's So Important About a Flag?

#### Civic Pride

#### Unity

#### Representation

#### Leading the Region and Nation

Before us sits a unique opportunity to be a torchbearer for the idea of uniting under a new and fresh symbol. Forward-thinking municipalities across the nation are starting to get serious about their flags, and Nashville should rank among them.

### What Makes a Good Flag? {#good-and-bad}

#### Simplicity
Our city is complicated and intricate, but our flag doesn’t have to be. A good flag is made up of only a few main visual elements. You should be able to describe it accurately to someone who’s never seen it before. A child should be able to draw it freehand from memory.

#### Meaning
Nashville is rich with culture and history, and we should wear it with pride. Our city is more than just a seal on a bedsheet. Colors, shapes, iconography, and relationships between elements can all convey meaning in a pleasing and practical manner.

#### Colorful
Simple color palettes help flags remain iconic and striking. A good flag will be used in a variety of media and contexts, and simple, solid colors will allow our flag’s design to work not only as a sheet of cloth, but on paper, screens, clothing, and more.

#### Bold
A city’s seal or coat of arms serves a great purpose, but that purpose is not on a flag. Flags are most often viewed at a distance and in motion, which makes the small details in a seal or words of any kind very difficult to make out. And unlike symbols, words only convey meaning if you are able to read the language they’re written in.

#### Distinctive
There are thousands of flags in the world, some of which are similar, but the best ones can’t be confused for anything else. Our city is unique and unlike any other, and it deserves a unique flag to represent it.

#### Inclusive
The five previous principles come straight from the fine folks at the North American Vexillological Association, and they are the gold standard for flag design guidelines. We propose one additional principle: a flag’s design should be accessible and inclusive to all those it represents.

Like the United States itself, our city is awash with many different cultures. But rather than homogenize our various ideals, we should embrace and respect what makes these backgrounds special and unique. We should understand that symbols, words, and even colors convey meaning in different ways to different people, including to those that are differently abled.

As such, a flag should represent all citizens regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, creed, language, physical ability, mental capacity, and even visual acuity. If we follow NAVA’s five principles, most of this will come naturally. But let’s make sure to go the extra mile.

### Why Fix What Isn’t Broken?
We would argue that Nashville’s flag is broken. Out of the six principles listed above, it fails every single one. Our previous city flag was a little better, but still falls down under scrutiny. We can and must do better.

Our current flag features lettering and tiny details that are completely lost when viewed in a flag’s typical setting. The colors are garish and lack meaning. The primary element of the flag is the city’s seal, the true meaning of which is unknown. Not only is it indistinct, it could easily be confused for dozens of other municipal flags that follow the same format.

Keeping the current flag isn’t likely to actively hurt our city, but changing it represents an opportunity to create a rallying symbol for our community and put Nashville on the map in yet another arena.

### What Should Nashville’s Flag Look Like?
#### Layout
There’s no single way to design a flag. They come in all shapes, sizes, and layouts. Vexillologists define common layouts like a canton, pale, fess, or saltire, but none of these are rules to be followed. Ideally, our flag should conform to the North American standard of 3 feet by 5 feet.

#### Color
NAVA defines the basic flag colors as red, blue, green, black, yellow, and white. Certainly there is room for exploration beyond these, but a standard palette helps reinforce good design principles. Special consideration should be paid to clarity for people with all levels of visual acuity, including color blindness. 

#### Shapes
Basic shapes have a home on many different flags, from nations to cities. Bars, stripes, crosses, stars, circles, crescents, and other shapes can not only be attractive design elements, they can convey meaning through placement, number, size, and relationship.

#### Symbolism
##### Growth & Opportunity
One of the few elements of Nashville’s current flag that makes sense is the compass rose encircling the city’s seal. According to the city’s historians, this represents “the unlimited horizons of the opportunities ahead.” Considering our explosive growth, this is as true today as it was 50 years ago.

##### Cumberland River
Throughout the 1800’s, the Cumberland became the lifeblood of the settlement by enabling rapid growth and economic expansion via riverboat trade. In May of 2010, the destruction caused by the flooding of the river’s banks brought Nashvillians together to regroup and rebuild.

##### State Capital & Largest City
Nashville became the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee in 1826, and is home to the state’s legislature. While we won’t officially know for a few years, recent estimates suggest Nashville has surpassed Memphis as the state’s most populous city.

##### Consolidated City-County
Originally two separate entities, what we think of as Nashville today is actually a consolidated and unified city and county, the first of its kind in the nation. Merged in 1963, Nashville and Davidson County make up one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States.

##### Music
Since the mid-1900’s, music and Nashville have been intertwined, and today the city is the second-largest center of music production in the nation. And it’s not just country -- every genre of music is represented, including pop, rock, jazz, and even opera.

##### Healthcare
The healthcare industry is responsible for more jobs in Nashville than any other, and it brings in nearly $40 billion to our local economy every year. Our world-class healthcare facilities are a shining example of Southern hospitality.

##### Schools
Vanderbilt, Belmont, Lipscomb, Tennessee State, Trevecca… these are just the most well-known colleges and universities in the city. Our legendary higher education institutions and pioneering public school system has earned us the moniker “Athens of the South.”

##### Forts
Fort Nashborough was the inflection point for what would eventually become our entire great city, and Fort Negley was the largest inland fort built during the American Civil War. Both of these structures have become important historic sites in Nashville.

##### Food
Nashville cemented its place in the pantheon of Southern delicacies with our famous hot chicken, but we’ve also adopted many other down-home favorites and made them our own. From barbecue to biscuits, food is an inseparable part of our city’s culture.

##### Caves
Our region is well-known for its caverns, and important parts of Nashville’s history lie underground. French-Canadian fur trader Timothy Demonbreun, often referred to as our “first citizen,” originally settled in an unassuming cave on the banks of the Cumberland.

#### What To Avoid
##### Tennessee Flag
Tennessee’s flag is iconic, and one of the best-designed of any state. We love our state flag and don’t want to take anything away from it, so we would advise any Nashville city flag to avoid confusion with Tennessee’s flag.

##### Complicated Symbols
Complex iconography may have special meaning to our city, but it takes away from the design of a flag. To restate one of the guiding principles of flag design, symbols should be able to be drawn in their entirety from memory. This increases recall and allows the design to be used in a variety of ways without alteration.

##### Intricate Lines or Cuts
Flag production can be complicated and expensive, so let’s strive to remove as many roadblocks as possible. Shapes and symbols should have clean, smooth edges with as few curves and angles as possible. For example, a 1:1 recreation of the Cumberland River would not translate well to a flag, but a simplified and stylized version could work.

### Who Else Is Doing This?
At least 50 municipalities across the United States are experiencing government-led or grassroots efforts to change and improve their city flags. Here are just a few of the most notable examples.

#### Provo, UT
This suburb of Salt Lake City threw out one of the nation’s worst city flags and officially adopted a beautiful new design, unanimously approved by its city council.

#### South Bend, IN
South Bend held a groundbreaking design contest for their new city flag. Officially unveiled in 2016, the design is open-source and belongs to the people.

#### Bellingham, WA
While still unofficial, Bellingham’s fresh flag is gaining popularity with local businesses and organizations. Its designer hopes that it will be adopted someday soon.

#### Milwaukee, WI
The flag of Wisconsin’s largest city has been called a “hot mess,” and a “train wreck,” among other things. Enterprising designer Steve Kodis started a campaign to change that. This stunning new design is awaiting an official hearing.

#### San Francisco, CA
While it’s still in the early stages, podcaster and vexillophile Roman Mars, who has inspired many flag redesign efforts across the nation, hopes to eventually improve the flag of one of America’s largest cities.

### What Will It Take to Make It Official?
While we referenced Nashville’s “current” flag throughout this project, neither the Charter or Code of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County actually designate an official design for the city’s flag. Our end goal is to add official language to the city’s guiding documents describing and codifying a new official flag.

This is not as easy as it sounds. For an ordinance (or “bill”) to be enacted or a resolution to be adopted, it must be presented and read in front of at least one Council meeting, and before that it must be heard and discussed at a Committee meeting.

Members of the public generally do not speak at Metro Council meetings, and although Committee meetings are open to the public, citizens may not testify at these meetings unless called upon by a Committee member.

Our best hope of pushing an official and legal flag redesign forward is to work with individual members of appropriate Metro Committees, gain allies across the Council, and find a sponsor who will present an ordinance that will eventually be read and voted upon at a Metro Council meeting.

But before we can do any of that, we have to show Council members that this idea has the broad support of taxpayers, organizations, and businesses across our city. That’s why we’re soliciting your signatures on a petition and recruiting volunteers in all facets of Nashville life to reach out to anyone who will listen.

While the Council is sometimes divided on issues, we believe we have identified some key players within our city’s legislature that will agree with our assessment of Nashville’s current flag and work with us on a resolution. With the help of these men and women, we have high hopes that our arguments will be heard. From there, we are at the mercy of the Council and their process.

Another possible (albeit much less likely) path is to get the Mayor to issue an executive order declaring a new official flag. We do not find this option likely and therefore will not pursue it as an option, barring extreme circumstances.

We’re not sure how long this will take. If we get overwhelming support from the public and find enthusiastic partners on the Council, the timeline could be short. But we want to be realistic and take our time to get things right, so we anticipate that it will be at least a year from the time of the project's inception before a bill would even be read before the Council.

If the worst happens and we are unable to find support with the Metro City Council, there’s nothing stopping us as the people of Nashville from uniting under a new People’s Flag. While this flag won’t be legal or official, it will still be ours. Bellingham and Milwaukee are excellent case studies of this scenario. In both instances, the redesigned flags have gained immense support from citizen, and official adoption could still be in their future.

### How Can I Help?	{#help}
#### Sign the Petition
The best and easiest thing you can do is sign our petition on [x]. Proving that members of the community support the idea of giving Nashville a new flag will be the key to gaining interest and support among the Metro Council, who will ultimately decide the final legal fate of this project.

#### Submit Your Design
The designs we’ve presented here are just samples, and are by no means the final designs we will be choosing from or presenting to Council members. If there’s a good idea out there for Nashville’s new flag, we want to see it.

If you have an idea for a flag design, there are a few ways to submit it. If you’re a professional artist or designer with access to tools like Photoshop or Illustrator, feel free to submit your design digitally using our online submission form. If you’re not the digital type or you just prefer doing your work on paper, download our worksheet, print it out, and send it back using the included instructions.

We welcome flag designs from anyone who’d like to participate in the project, but special consideration will be given to artists who call Nashville home.

#### Sponsor Our Movement
If you run a business or organization who supports this effort, we would love your official endorsement. Support from commercial or charitable enterprises will carry real weight when working with the Council, and your name attached to this project would make a huge difference. Cash or in-kind donations are by no means required, but are greatly appreciated if they meet the project’s specific needs.

#### Share Your Contacts
Nashville is a famously friendly town where everybody knows everybody. As such, you probably have some really important friends or acquaintances at local businesses, organizations, or within our city’s government. If you do, we’d love for you to make an introduction. Feel free to CC us ([x]) on any communication to your associates regarding this project.

#### Volunteer to Spread the Word
We are excited about the prospect of a groundswell of support for this project in the community, but we can’t reach everyone on our own. We need you to share with your friends, family, and colleagues. If you have the means and ability, pass out flyers or hang them publicly in your office. Approach local organizations to garner their support and feedback. Talk to people on the street about the project. If you can’t do anything else, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and share our story via social media with your network.

#### Donate
We know this process will be long, difficult, and tiring. Fortunately, we don’t think it will be very expensive. Our campaign’s primary costs will come from logistical items like printing flyers, mailing documents, legal paperwork application fees, and web hosting. We would also love to be able to pay reasonable fees to the talented artists and designers who have helped us along the way. 

Any and all money raised during this campaign will go directly towards fostering support among citizens and the Metro Council to adopt a new flag design. Our members are doing this as a passion project and will never take any form of payment.

This project will happen even if the costs have to come out of our pockets, but if you have the means and would like to donate, you can do so via PayPal, Square Cash, or Facebook. [x]
