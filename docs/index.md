# Why Does Nashville Need a New Flag?

# What's So Important About a Flag?

## Civic Pride

## Unity

## Representation

## Leading the Region and Nation
Before us sits a unique opportunity to be a torchbearer for the idea of uniting under a new and fresh symbol. Forward-thinking municipalities across the nation are starting to get serious about their flags, and Nashville should rank among them.

## Business and Tourism
An iconic flag will strengthen our city's identity outside of our borders as well. Pairing our flag design with sightseeing and photo opportunities, for example, helps spread the idea of Nashville as a place to visit. And merchandise featuring our flag provides a new channel for additional tax revenue for the city.
